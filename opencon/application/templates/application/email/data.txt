<p>OpenCon is more than a conference. It’s a community supported through active forums, programs and online and in-person events throughout the year that are open to everyone – and we encourage you to get involved right away. Below are some ideas to get started.</p>

<p><strong>Top 4 Ways to Get Involved with OpenCon</strong></p>

<p><strong>(1) RSVP to attend OpenCon Live.</strong> Even if you are not invited to attend in person, you can still participate remotely in OpenCon 2018 through our online program, OpenCon Live. Let us know that you plan to participate in OpenCon 2018 either way by submitting your RSVP: <a href="http://www.opencon2018.org/opencon_2018_live">http://www.opencon2018.org/opencon_2018_live</a></p>

<p><strong>(2) Host or attend an OpenCon Satellite Event.</strong> You can help build the Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data movements by organizing or attending an OpenCon satellite event. Satellite events are locally organized events that combine content, themes and ideas from the main meeting with locally arranged activities—and can be organized by anyone, anywhere, at any time of the year. In 2016, we had over 2000 people participate in satellite events across twenty different countries! Attend an event in your region: <a href="http://www.opencon2018.org/attend">http://www.opencon2018.org/attend</a> Don’t see an event close to you on our map?

Connect with the global OpenCon community through our Community Calls and at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23opencon&src=typd">#OpenCon</a>.
